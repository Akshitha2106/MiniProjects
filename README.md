## How To Contribute to This Project

* Add a project(small scale would work as well).
To do so, first create an issue with the task you are doing, for example: "Issue - creating QR Code generator in Python". `HacktoberFest` label will be added to the issue. Create a pull request in response to that issue and finally submit it for review.

* Create a directory for any new project if it doesn't exist.
	eg. `QR Code Generator`, `News App`.
	Inside these directories you can create your own file named `program_name.language_extension` (`qr.py`)
	Create a commit of the form - fixes #(issue_number)

* Finally, wait for it to be merged!
